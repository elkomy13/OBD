# Vehicle Data Analysis and Classification Model
# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive vehicle data analysis and classification model built using Python. The model processes and analyzes telemetry data from vehicles, extracting meaningful insights and predicting vehicle performance issues based on various parameters. The project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, including ensemble methods and support vector machines, to classify vehicle data into distinct categories.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: The model includes robust data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are generated to understand the distribution of features and relationships between variables, aiding in the identification of patterns and anomalies.
Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining significant variance, facilitating better model performance and interpretability.
Clustering: K-Means clustering is implemented to group similar data points, providing insights into the underlying structure of the data.
Model Training and Evaluation: A variety of machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, are trained and evaluated. The model performance is assessed using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search is utilized to optimize model parameters, ensuring the best possible performance.
Learning Curves: Learning curves are plotted to visualize model performance over varying training set sizes, helping to diagnose potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
